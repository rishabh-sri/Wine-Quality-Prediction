# Wine-Quality-Prediction

On the weekend, most of us prefer having a fancy dinner with our loved ones. While the kids define a fancy dinner as one that has pasta, adults like to add a cherry on top by having a classic glass of red wine along with the Italian dish. But when it comes to shopping for that wine bottle, a few of us get confused about which is the best one to buy. Few believe that the longer it has been fermented, the better it'll taste. Few suggest relatively sweeter wines are good quality wines. To know a precise answer, I tried building your wine Quality Predictor.
